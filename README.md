Hello! I'm Gustavo, a Brazilian software development student with a strong focus on continuous learning and technical growth. 
I have a medium level of experience and am currently focused on deepening my understanding of programming concepts, building personal projects, and exploring areas like web development and software architecture.

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the desire to create clean, functional, and user-centered applications. Outside of programming, I enjoy activities that challenge my mind and creativity, such as chess, writing, and music.

I'm always open to learning opportunities, collaboration, and constructive feedback as I continue to grow in the tech field.
