Hey :D

So... my name is Gustavo, i'm currently learning web development mainly with HTML, CSS and JS, but i also got some knowledge in NodeJS and SQL. My future plans are to learn React and maybe Game Development, but the second one is a more secondary project.

You can reach me in my e-mail: zuingustavo206@gmail.com

And that's pretty much it... bye bye <3
